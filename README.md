# stepbystep
An example document used at BachoTeX 2023

## What is this?
Here you find the ConTeXt source files for a presentation I gave at BachoTeX in 
2023. The idea was to show in a step-by-step manner one possible way to set up a 
ConTeXt document.

## Generating the pdf files
All you need is an installation of [ConTeXT lmtx](https://www.pragma-ade.com/install.htm). To generate the pdf files, 
run `context` first on `stepbystep.mkxl` to get `stepbystep.pdf`. Then run `context` on `bachotex-stepbystep.mkxl`. It 
will include pages from `stepbystep.pdf`.
